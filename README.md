The objective of this project is to create a system that stores adversary playbooks
and is capable of transferring data between different users. The project accomplishes
this by utilizing the STIX standard format for individual profiled attacks. Included in
the project is a web front-end that enables searching, viewing, editing, creating, and
deleting playbooks.
According to the Customerâ€™s Technical Specifications we have identified four main
components that shall comprise the Adversarial Playbook application architecture:
1) Data store
2) Playbook Manager Application Programming Interface (API)
3) STIX Processor
4) Web Interface
